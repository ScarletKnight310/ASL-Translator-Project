# ASL Translator Project
 The overall goal is create a program that uses a generic web camera to process American Sign Language (ASL), then translates the processed information into American English. I plan to use Deep-Learning Algorithms to process hand gestures, this will include both dynamic and static signs. A lot of the base code for data collection and model construction is based on Nicholas Renotte's project https://github.com/nicknochnack/ActionDetectionforSignLanguage. Thank you Nick!
